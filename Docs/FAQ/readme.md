Next, navigate to [The Web Flasher](https://ashtf8.github.io/PocketMage_PDA/) in a **chrome-based browser** and select your firmware version. The **most recent stable build** is recommended. If you would like to keep your saved settings, ensure that the "Preserve user data during installation" check box is **checked**. Next, hit the flash button and select the PocketMage from the list of USB devices. Once the flashing is done, unplug your PocketMage and re-insert the battery. PocketMage should boot up automatically!
